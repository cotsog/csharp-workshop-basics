/**
    Write a program that returns the first n prime
    numbers as comma separated values in a string.

    A prime number is a positive integer that has exactly
    two positive integer factors, 1 and itself. 

    Another way of saying this is that a prime number is a
    positive integer that is not the product of two smaller positive integers.
    For example:
    Given: n = 3
    Return: "2,3,5"

    Given: n = 0 (or any negative)
    Return: ""

    Given: n = 10
    Return: "2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29"

    Method signature:     findFirstPrimeNumbers(int n)
    Return value:         string
    Access modifier:      public static
